STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR
This program uses a switch statement to determine the correct grade based on the student's marks. The switch statement uses the true value to compare the cases. Each case corresponds to a range of marks, and sets the grade variable accordingly. The default case is used for marks less than 40, which corresponds to grade E. Finally, the program outputs the grade to the console.

SPEED DETECTOR

This program prompts the user to input the car's speed, and then converts the input to a number using the Number function. It then uses an if statement to calculate the number of demerit points based on the car's speed. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the number of demerit points is 0. Otherwise, the number of demerit points is calculated using the formula (speed - 70) / 5, and rounded down to the nearest integer using the Math.floor function. The program then outputs the result to the console using if statements. If the number of demerit points is 0, the program outputs "Ok" to the console. Otherwise, the program outputs the number of demerit points to the console using a template literal. If the number of demerit points is greater than 12, the program outputs "License suspended" to the user.
